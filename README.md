# swe432_doctor_appointment

Step 1:

Four Baseline Scenarios

[1] Registration (Completed)

A patient using the website may register using a unique email and some password.
He/She must use this registered information across the website to request appointments.

[2] Appointment Request

A patient for the website can request an appointment for a certain time of the day. He must enter in his email and password and he cannot request an appointment on a time is already taken. 

[3] Email Verification (Completed)

A Web Service running from Nodejs on my computer, which has installed a module called email-verify will be used to check if an email is actually valid upon signing up for an account.

[4] Calendar

Users can see a calendar of times that are available for an appointment so they don't need to try and see if a time area they chose is valid. This will be created using D3.js
