Project : Doctor Appointment 
Coolaboration: Poyung Kim, Kien Nguyen, 

Project Logic Description

This project will create a web application that allow clients to make an appointment for a medical service with a group of doctors and for doctors to keep track of their daily schedule.
Clients

[1] To make an appointment, a client will select a date and the type of health issue, then pick the name of the physician/doctor he/she wants. The program will diplay a list of services that the doctor/physician provides, along with the cost and the time available for the client's selected date.

[2] The client picks the service he needs, then uses his/her phone or email to confirm his decision. The web program will send the confirmation to the client's email or through a text message.

[3] The client can search their appointments page to check their appointment. The web program will email or text the client a reminder when the appointment is a day away.

[4] The client can later log into their account and CANCEL or MOVE their appointment schedule.
Doctor/Physicians.

[1] Doctors can log in to check their schedule. After logging in, the doctor can either VIEW their schedule on particular date, or CANCEL or request to MOVE a client's appointment. In case of moving, client will receive a notification and need to confirm with the new schedule so it can be effective.

[2] Doctors can also ADD/REMOVE/UPDATE any other schedule (that they received outside the program) manually.

[3] Doctors can also turn on/off their reminder function.

Project Technical requirements

This project will use D3js to add some visual effects on presenting a calendar and list of schedule for clients and doctors. It will also use either a Texting API such as "Textingly", or an email Validation API such as "Email Hippo Email Validation" to verify/remind the client for their appointment. The webapp also will use a database on the server side to store important schemas and to render appropriate information such as the doctor information or new appointments onto the client side.


A. For client sides:
The web program shall:
- display date picker for client to pick the date they want
- display the list of doctors/physicians for client to pick
- display the list of services provide by the client chosen doctor/physician
- matches the service client picked with the current doctor/physicians schedule with the duration and availability of the service to create a valid appointment for client.
- send confirmation to client's email or sms to their phones once the appointment is created.
- view/update/move/delete client's appointment list using client phone number and confirmation via sms as log in.

B. For doctor/physician
- display doctor/physicians schedule of appoint on particular date, week, month
- view/update/move/delete appointment 
- send update status of appointment to clients

C. Technical Requirements and Server Side
